# Nexus
A Spigot block protection plugin inspired by [Citadel](https://github.com/Exultant/Citadel).

## The Basic Premise
The basic idea of the plugin is as follows: you place down a special Nexus block and it extends a limited field of protection around your
favourite build(s). Blocks that are "influenced" by a Nexus have a certain amount of health, based on their proximity to the Nexus. Hostile
players can bring the health of a block down by constantly breaking it until the health reaches 0, at which point the block will be
permanantly broken. Nexus blocks should be well protected, because any player can take control of one if they reach it!
